TAPAS Calibration codes

This repository contains calibration codes used to do external calibration of camera and IMU and external calibration of camera and 2D laser scanner. In case of robot TAPAS, we used:
- Microsoft LifeCam Studio
- Hokuyo UTM30-LX
- Microstrain 3DM-GX4-25

The presented codes are modified version of publicly available codes by J. Lobo and J. Dias (Camera-IMU calibration) and by Q. Zhang and R. Pless (Camera-Laser calibration). We only modified those coees to suit our needs.  If you find available code useful, please cite those guys to thank for the great job they did!
